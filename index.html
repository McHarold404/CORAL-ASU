<p>
  At the <b>CoRAL Lab</b>, we are at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge AI technologies across natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to develop advanced AI systems that excel in reasoning, controllability, and reliability, with a particular focus on navigating complex and structured data.
</p>

<p><b>Our Focus:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Human-Centric Innovations:</b> We leverage insights from human reasoning to craft techniques that adeptly handle a variety of data types, including tables, charts, and graphs. Our goal is to enhance AI's ability to understand and interact with complex datasets in ways that mirror human cognitive processes.</li>
  <li><b>Advanced Technologies:</b> Utilizing the latest advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs), we push the boundaries of AIâ€™s capabilities in interpreting and reasoning about text, spreadsheets, and multimedia content. This helps us build more robust and versatile AI systems.</li>
  <li><b>Real-World Impact:</b> Our research addresses a wide range of applications, from question-answering and inference to structure generation and neural-symbolic techniques. We focus on practical solutions for data extraction, intelligent document processing, and sophisticated data visualization, with applications spanning healthcare, finance, sports, e-commerce, and education.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Our Mission:</b></p>
<p>
  We are committed to revolutionizing industries by creating AI systems that enhance decision-making, automate complex processes, and ensure transparency and reliability. Our work drives meaningful improvements across a variety of sectors. We prioritize ethical, interpretable AI systems and strive for collaborations with academic institutions and industry partners to address real-world challenges and advance the field of AI.
</p>
